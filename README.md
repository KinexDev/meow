# Meow
Meow is a simple language (currently it isn't one) im making in C# as a side project written completely from scratch, currently it has number (10 + 3 * 2), boolean (true or false) and string parsing ("hello" + 10 -> "hello10", this operation concatenates everything else in the binary expression), generating ASTs and basic evaluation, these are the building blocks of the language, i am currently walking through the ASTs. I plan on making it similar to lua, it's set up as a REPL (read, eval, print, loop)
